"""Introduction to Python."""

# Python is a Free and Open Source, interpreted, high-level, general purpose programming language.
# Python allows for concise and readable code by using high-level data types, indentation for grouping, and eliminating the need for variable declarations.
#
# **Python's core philosophy is summarized in The Zen of Python (PEP 20).**
#
# Key principles include:
#
# - Beautiful is better than ugly.
# - Explicit is better than implicit.
# - Simple is better than complex.
# - Complex is better than complicated.
# - Readability counts.
#
#
# A high-level programming language abstracts low-level details, making coding easier. In Python, memory management is handled automatically, so developers don’t need to manage it manually. Low-level languages are closer to hardware, while high-level languages are more human-readable.
#
# Python does not require compilation to binary. Instead, it converts source code into bytecode, which is then interpreted into the computer’s native language and executed directly.
#
# By definition, an interpreter is a type of computer program that directly executes the instructions written in some programming or scripting language. By direct execution, we mean that it doesn't require the instructions to be compiled into a machine language program first.
#
#
#
# Python comes with a default interpreter that can be accessed via the terminal, but it has limitations like lack of syntax highlighting and tab completion.
#
# **Alternative interpreters include:**
#
# - IPython: An interactive shell with enhanced features, commonly used with Jupyter Notebook.
# - CPython: The default Python implementation, written in C, offering broad compatibility but limited by the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
# - IronPython: A Python implementation for the .NET framework, integrating Python with .NET libraries.
# - Jython: A Java-based Python implementation that converts Python code into Java bytecode, allowing execution on JVM.
# - PyPy: A high-performance alternative with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, making it significantly faster than CPython.
# - PythonNet: Provides seamless integration of Python with the .NET CLR, allowing Python and .NET code to work together.
#
# **Stackless** Python is an alternative Python interpreter that supports up to Python 3.7. Unlike CPython, it does not rely on the C call stack, instead clearing it between function calls. This allows for efficient microthreads, reducing the overhead of traditional OS threads. It also supports coroutines, communication channels, tasklets, and round-robin scheduling.
#
# Python supports both procedure-oriented programming (POP) and object-oriented programming (OOP). POP focuses on reusable functions, while OOP structures programs around objects combining data and behavior. Python's OOP approach is simpler and more intuitive than C++ or Java.
#
# Python allows integrating C, C++, or Java for performance-critical code or proprietary algorithms. This enhances speed and security while keeping Python’s ease of use. Python is both extensible (can call C/C++/Java code) and embeddable (can be embedded into other applications).
#
# **Why Use Anaconda?**
# - User-level installation without needing admin privileges.
# - Independent package management from system libraries.
# - Binary package installation with conda (no need for compilation like pip).
# - Simplifies dependency management, avoiding compatibility issues between packages.
# - Includes essential tools like NumPy, SciPy, PyQt, Spyder IDE, or allows custom installations via Miniconda.
# - Prevents conflicts with system libraries, ensuring a stable Python environment.
#
#
# The **IPython Qt** Console is a GUI-based interactive shell for Jupyter kernels. It enhances the terminal experience with syntax highlighting, inline figures, session export, and graphical call tips, making coding more efficient and user-friendly.
#
#
# **Spyder** is a free Python IDE included with Anaconda, designed for scientific computing. It offers editing, interactive testing, debugging, and introspection, making it a powerful tool for data analysis and development.
#
# Spyder is a powerful scientific Python IDE designed for scientists, engineers, and data analysts. It combines advanced editing, debugging, and profiling with interactive execution, data exploration, and visualization. Spyder also integrates seamlessly with scientific libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, IPython, Matplotlib, and SymPy, making it a comprehensive tool for data analysis and research.
#
#
# **Jupyter Notebook** is a web-based interactive computing tool that extends traditional console-based programming. It allows users to develop, document, and execute code while integrating explanatory text, mathematics, and rich media.
#
# It consists of:
#
# - A web application for creating interactive documents with code, text, and visual outputs.
# - Notebook documents that store inputs, outputs, text, and rich media for a complete computational record.
#
# Notebook documents (.ipynb files) store both inputs and outputs of an interactive session, along with explanatory text, mathematics, and rich media. They serve as a complete computational record, interleaving executable code with documentation. Internally, they are JSON files, making them easy to version-control and share with others.
