"""Algorithm complexity."""

# - `Worst-case complexity` – The maximum number of steps required for any input of size n. It is represented by the highest points in a complexity graph.
# - `Best-case complexity` – The minimum number of steps required for any input of size n. It is represented by the lowest points in a complexity graph.
# - `Average-case complexity` (expected time) – The average number of steps needed to process all inputs of size n.
#
#
# - `Constant functions, f(n) = 1` – Independent of n, e.g., adding two numbers or printing a fixed message.
# - `Logarithmic functions, f(n) = log n` – Common in algorithms like binary search, where execution time grows slowly as n increases.
# - `Linear functions, f(n) = n` – Represent operations that process each element once, such as searching for a value in an array.
# - `Superlinear functions, f(n) = n log n` – Found in efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort and merge sort.
# - `Quadratic functions, f(n) = n²` – Common in nested loops, such as insertion sort or selection sort.
# - `Cubic functions, f(n) = n³` – Used in enumerating triplets or certain dynamic programming problems.
# - `Exponential functions, f(n) = cⁿ (c > 1)` – Appear in problems like subset enumeration; impractical for large n.
# - `Factorial functions, f(n) = n!` – Found in brute-force permutation problems (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem); extremely slow for large n.
