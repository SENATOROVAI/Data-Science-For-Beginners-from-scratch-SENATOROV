# **NP and NP-Complete Problems**
# - NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time) includes problems for which a proposed solution can be verified in polynomial time.
# - A problem is NP-complete if:
#     - It is in NP.
#     - Every other NP problem can be reduced to it in polynomial time.
# - Example: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a classic NP-complete problem. While verifying a solution is easy, finding one can be very difficult.
#
# **Reduction**
# - A method used to show that one problem is at least as hard as another by transforming one into the other.
# - If an NP-complete problem can be reduced to another problem, and that problem can be solved efficiently, then all NP problems can be solved efficiently.
#
# **NP-Hard Problems**
# - NP-hard problems are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP.
# - They don’t have to be in NP, meaning their solutions may not be verifiable in polynomial time.
# - These problems are extremely challenging and central to understanding computational difficulty.
# - Example: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard.
#
# **Practical Significance**
# - NP-hard and NP-complete problems appear in real-world applications like logistics, scheduling, and resource allocation.
# - Efficient solutions can transform industries by improving optimization and reducing costs.
#
# **Heuristics and Approximation Algorithms**
# - Since exact solutions for NP-hard problems are often infeasible, `heuristic` and `approximate algorithms` are used to find “good enough” solutions efficiently.
# - These methods aim to balance solution quality and computational effort.
