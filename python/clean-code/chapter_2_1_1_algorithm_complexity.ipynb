    "- `Logarithmic functions, f(n) = log n` – Common in algorithms like binary search, where execution time grows slowly as n increases.\n",
    "- `Linear functions, f(n) = n` – Represent operations that process each element once, such as searching for a value in an array.\n",
    "- `Superlinear functions, f(n) = n log n` – Found in efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort and merge sort.\n",
    "- `Quadratic functions, f(n) = n²` – Common in nested loops, such as insertion sort or selection sort.\n",
    "- `Cubic functions, f(n) = n³` – Used in enumerating triplets or certain dynamic programming problems.\n",
    "- `Exponential functions, f(n) = cⁿ (c > 1)` – Appear in problems like subset enumeration; impractical for large n.\n",
    "- `Factorial functions, f(n) = n!` – Found in brute-force permutation problems (e.g., Traveling Salesman Problem); extremely slow for large n."
