    "**NP and NP-Complete Problems**\n",
    "- NP (Nondeterministic Polynomial time) includes problems for which a proposed solution can be verified in polynomial time.\n",
    "- A problem is NP-complete if:\n",
    "    - It is in NP.\n",
    "    - Every other NP problem can be reduced to it in polynomial time.\n",
    "- Example: The Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) is a classic NP-complete problem. While verifying a solution is easy, finding one can be very difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduction**\n",
    "- A method used to show that one problem is at least as hard as another by transforming one into the other.\n",
    "- If an NP-complete problem can be reduced to another problem, and that problem can be solved efficiently, then all NP problems can be solved efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NP-Hard Problems**\n",
    "- NP-hard problems are at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP.\n",
    "- They don’t have to be in NP, meaning their solutions may not be verifiable in polynomial time.\n",
    "- These problems are extremely challenging and central to understanding computational difficulty.\n",
    "- Example: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is NP-hard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical Significance**\n",
    "- NP-hard and NP-complete problems appear in real-world applications like logistics, scheduling, and resource allocation.\n",
    "- Efficient solutions can transform industries by improving optimization and reducing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Heuristics and Approximation Algorithms**\n",
    "- Since exact solutions for NP-hard problems are often infeasible, `heuristic` and `approximate algorithms` are used to find “good enough” solutions efficiently.\n",
    "- These methods aim to balance solution quality and computational effort."
