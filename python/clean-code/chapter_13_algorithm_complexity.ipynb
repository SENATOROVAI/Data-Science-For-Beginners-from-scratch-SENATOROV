    "For small programs, performance is often negligible. \n",
    "However, when optimization is needed, Python’s `timeit` and `cProfile` modules help measure execution time \n",
    "and identify bottlenecks for improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `timeit` module in Python’s standard library measures the execution speed of small code \n",
    "snippets by running them thousands or millions of times and calculating the average runtime.\n",
    "It temporarily disables garbage collection for more stable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import timeit\n",
    "\n",
    "timeit.timeit(\"a, b = 42, 101; a = a ^ b; b = a ^ b; a = a ^ b\")  # 0.1307766629999998\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the code passed to `timeit.timeit()` cannot access variables and functions from the rest of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "To fix this, pass `globals()` as the globals argument:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "timeit.timeit(\"print(spam)\", number=1, globals=globals())\n",
    "# hello\n",
    "# 0.000994909999462834\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `cProfile` module is more effective than `timeit` for analyzing entire functions or programs.\n",
    "It systematically measures execution time, memory usage, and function call details, providing a comprehensive performance profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use `cProfile`, pass the function or code to `cProfile.run()`:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When using cProfile, the output contains several key metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `ncalls` – Number of times the function was called.\n",
    " - `tottime` – Total execution time of the function, excluding sub-functions.\n",
    " - `percall` – Time per call (tottime divided by ncalls).\n",
    " - `cumtime` – Cumulative time spent in the function, including sub-function calls.\n",
    " - `percall` (cumulative) – cumtime divided by ncalls.\n",
    " - `filename:lineno(function)` – The file and line number where the function is defined.\n",

    "**Big-O notation** is a method for analyzing algorithms that describes how execution\n",
    "time scales with input size. It helps evaluate efficiency and predict performance as the input grows.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Big-O notation** categorizes algorithm efficiency by growth rate as input size increases. Ordered from best (least slowdown) to worst (most slowdown):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `O(1)` – Constant time (fastest, e.g., accessing an array element).\n",
    "- `O(log n)` – Logarithmic time (e.g., binary search).\n",
    "- `O(n)` – Linear time (e.g., iterating through a list).\n",
    "- `O(n log n)` – Quasilinear time (e.g., merge sort, quicksort).\n",
    "- `O(n²)` – Quadratic time (e.g., nested loops, bubble sort).\n",
    "- `O(2ⁿ)` – Exponential time (e.g., recursive Fibonacci).\n",
    "- `O(n!)` – Factorial time (slowest, e.g., brute-force permutations).\n",
    "Lower complexities are ideal, while higher ones can become impractical for large inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `O(1) (Constant Time)`: Checking if a bookshelf is empty – the number of books doesn't affect the time.\n",
    "- `O(log n) (Logarithmic Time)`: Binary search – finding a book in an alphabetically sorted shelf by repeatedly halving the search space.\n",
    "- `O(n) (Linear Time)`: Reading all books on a shelf – if the number of books doubles, the time required also doubles.\n",
    "- `O(n log n) (N-Log-N Time)`: Sorting books alphabetically – each book is placed using binary search (O(log n)),\n",
    "and this process repeats for n books, resulting in O(n log n).\n",
    "Efficient sorting algorithms like merge sort, quicksort, and Timsort follow this complexity.\n",
    "- `O(n²) (Quadratic Time)`: Checking for duplicate books on an unordered shelf – each book is compared\n",
    "with every other book, resulting in O(n × n). Doubling the books quadruples the number of operations.\n",
    "Common in nested loops and inefficient sorting algorithms like bubble sort.\n",
    "- `O(2ⁿ) (Exponential Time)`: Photographing all possible book arrangements on a shelf – each\n",
    "book can either be included or not, leading to 2ⁿ combinations.\n",
    "Common in brute-force algorithms like subset generation or solving the traveling salesman problem.\n",
    "- `O(n!) (Factorial Time)`: Photographing books in every possible order – there are n! (factorial) permutations of n books.\n",
    "This complexity grows extremely fast and is common in brute-force algorithms like traveling salesman problem (TSP) and generating all permutations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "`Big-O Notation` Analyzes Worst-Case Scenario: It estimates the maximum time an algorithm\n",
    "will take as input size grows. This helps evaluate performance bottlenecks and scalability,\n",
    "ensuring an algorithm handles the most demanding cases efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Ω (Big-Omega)` Notation Describes Best-Case Scenario: It represents the minimum time an algorithm takes.\n",
    "For example, an algorithm with Ω(n) runs at least in linear time in the best case.\n",
    "While Big-O (O) focuses on the worst-case, Big-Omega (Ω) helps analyze the best possible efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Θ (Big-Theta)` Notation Describes Tight Bounds: It applies when an algorithm has the same complexity\n",
    "in both best-case (Ω) and worst-case (O) scenarios. For example, Θ(n)\n",
    "means the algorithm always runs in linear time. While Big-O is more commonly used,\n",
    "Big-Theta provides a more precise performance estimate."
